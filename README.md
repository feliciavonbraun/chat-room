# ChatALot

Welcome to <b>ChatALot</b>! <br>
Sign in with a name of your choice and start chatting away with your friends!
In this app, you can chat in the default room ('Living room') or you can 
create your own room and let people come to you. If you have some secrets that 
you don't want to share with the rest of the world, you are free to create a room 
with a password! Share it carefully with people you trust. 

<b>REMEMBER</b>. When you are the only one left in a room, and you decide to leave the room - the room will disappear so don't leave anything unsaid in there!
